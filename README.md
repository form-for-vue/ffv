## Development

### Build

Bundle the js and css of to the `dist` folder:

npm run build
```


## Publishing

The `prepublish` hook will ensure dist files are created before publishing. This
way you don't need to commit them in your repository.

```bash
# Bump the version first
# It'll also commit it and create a tag
npm version
# Push the bumped package and tags
git push --follow-tags
# Ship it ðŸš€
npm publish
```
